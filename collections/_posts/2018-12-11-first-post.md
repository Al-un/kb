Time to build my KB website. I aimed at storing here how I did and do stuff,
especially regarding the problem I encountered. I often have the "Oh yeah,
I know I had a link to solve this problem but what was it again?".

So far, the design is pretty simple:

- **articles** list the content
- **posts** work as a history tracker

> TODO: how to link articles/posts with relevant repostories and commit
