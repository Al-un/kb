### Testing click behaviour

When testing rendered button, we want to make sure that clicking the component
triggers the appropriate props. Rather than checking the `onClick` props of the
rendered button, it is easier to simulate a click:

```javascript
describe("Delete button", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    onDeleteFn = jest.fn();
    deleteButton = shallow(<DeleteButton deleteFunc={onDeleteFn} />);
  });

  it("click triggers delete function", () => {
    deleteButton.simulate("click");
    expect(onDeleteFn).toBeCalled();
  });
});
```

### Snapshot testing

Very cool feature for non regression testing. If not done yet, add `yard add --dev react-test-renderer`.
And it is now as simple as:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";
import { MyComponent } from "my-component-path;

describe("My Component", () => {
    it ('match snapshot', () => {
      const tree = renderer
        .create(<MyComponent someparam="somevalue" />)
        .toJSON();
      expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
    })
});
```
