title: Updating KB collections
articles:
  - _kb/jekyll/filter.md
---

Initially, KB collections structure of this website was:

```
- collection
    - _circleci
    - _css
    - _javascript
    - _jekyll
    - ...
    - _posts
    - ...
```

but it resulted in a loooot of duplicates:

- collection definition in `_config.yml`
- collection default front matters in `_config.yml`
- data entry in `data/kb.yml`

For the data file, it is quite light and the user friendly name has to be stored
somewhere so nothing will be changed. However, collection structure could be improved

I then switched to:

```
- collection
    - _kb
        - circleci
        - css
        - javascript
        - jekyll
        - ...
    - _posts
```

Notice that technology names have stripped the underscore prefix.

Like this:

- only one collection definition and default front matters in `_config.yml`
- technologies list is dynamic provided the name is input in `kb.yml` data file

However, it breaks the KB menu (on the left) and the linking from posts to articles

- posts to articles links are easily updated (change collection folder)
- KB page menu must involve grouping by a front matter, which is kind of duplicating
  this information but as these front matters are generated by a script, it's OK
